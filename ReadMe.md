(Storing the steam description in here so I don't lose it after updates)

Welcome back a familiar not quite friend in a not quite familiar body.

[h1]The Rundown[/h1]
Agent Shen's got a particular history with XCOM (and especially with Chief Lily Shen), but as for Chimera Squad, he's been a surprisingly good fit for the squad.

Like a conventional Android, he can use SMGs, shotguns, and assault rifles. Unlike conventional androids, he has specialized in being a gunner, able to output many shots, and knowing the best locations to fire at, not for precision reasons, but for more demolition oriented reasons.

His starting abilities is Deadeye, a familiar option if you've used Blueblood, and [b]Battle Droid[/b], an ability that lets him shoot without ending his turn.

His breach ability that needs to be unlocked is [b]Demolition[/b], this is a seemingly normal attack, but even if he misses a target, the shot will destroy the cover off the target. Useful, if you need to double team an aggressive target.

His first passive choice is between Return Fire, and [b]Kill Confirm[/b], which grants Julian double damage on the last two shots of his primary weapon.

His second active is [b]Hail of Bullets[/b], it uses 3 ammo and can't crit, but is guaranteed to hit.

His second passive choice is between [b]Robotic Reflexes[/b], granting him +15 aim with reaction fire and the ability to crit with them, and [b]Hello There[/b], which enables his first two shots of his primary weapon to destroy cover, akin to his breach ability.

His final active is [b]Rapid Fire[/b], allowing Julian to burst down a target in one go. This is a one time per mission ability, so use it wisely.

[h1]Other Mechanics[/h1]
Julian generally works like the other agents of Chimera Squad and not like other Androids, due to a specialized body developed by Chief Shen. This means he can benefits from healing abilities like the others, along with being able to "bleed" out when taking enough damage, instead of blowing up. Conversely this does mean he can not use the android modification that can be developed, however.

[h1]How to receive[/h1]
Easiest, simplest way: start a new game. He'll automatically be in HQ.

Less easy: due to complications, the current only way to get him in an in-progress game is to open the change difficulty screen and click on the green button to try saving any changes. Note that you do not actually have to change difficulties, just press the green button to get him added to HQ. I can do this part more seamlessly once relevant changes to the game's code (or the community highlander for this game is uploaded) have been done.

I do plan on trying to figure out how to get him recruited like an actual agent like the rest, I just want to upload this now since we have 90% of a framework for making new agents that you can view here if you want to learn from what I did: https://github.com/RealityMachina/Agent-Julian

(Like I don't care if you reuse code, I would've just uploaded the source files for the scripts directly alongside the mod if the uploader would've let me)
